    <h1 class="text-h3 mb-4">The Job Shop Scheduling Problem</h1>

    <p>
      The Job Shop Scheduling Problem is a classic optimization problem in which a set of jobs need to be processed on a
      set of machines. Each job consists of multiple tasks that must be completed in a specific order, and each task
      requires a certain amount of time to be processed on a particular machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the problem is to determine the optimal sequence of tasks for each job and the allocation of machines
      to minimize the total completion time or makespan, which is the time it takes for all jobs to be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Job Shop Scheduling Problem is NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution becomes increasingly
      difficult as the number of jobs and machines increases. Various algorithms and heuristics, such as genetic
      algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search, have been developed to address this problem.
