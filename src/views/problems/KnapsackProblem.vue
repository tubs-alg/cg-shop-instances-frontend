    <h1 class="text-h3 mb-4">The Knapsack Problem</h1>

    <p>
      The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem that is widely studied in computer science and
      combinatorial optimization. It is named after the problem of a thief who must fill a knapsack with items of
      different weights and values while maximizing the total value of the items and not exceeding the weight capacity
      of the knapsack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formally, the problem can be defined as follows: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a
      knapsack with a maximum weight capacity, determine the most valuable combination of items to include in the
      knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knapsack Problem can be categorized into two main types: the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, where each item can be
      either included or excluded from the knapsack (i.e., fractional items are not allowed), and the Fractional
      Knapsack Problem, where items can be included in fractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knapsack Problem is NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution becomes increasingly difficult as the
      number of items increases. Various algorithms and techniques, such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and
      branch and bound, are commonly employed to solve instances of the Knapsack Problem efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knapsack Problem has numerous real-world applications, including resource allocation, budget planning, and
      portfolio optimization, making it a fundamental problem in optimization theory with widespread practical
      significance.
