    <h1 class="text-h3 mb-4">Configuration Sampling Problem</h1>

    <p>
      The Configuration Sampling Problem is a challenging optimization problem that arises in software engineering,
      particularly in the domain of software product line engineering. It involves finding an optimal set of
      configurations for a software system that fulfills given constraints and covers certain feature tuples.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a software product line, different products are derived from a common set of features, where each product
      represents a specific configuration of features. The Configuration Sampling Problem aims to select a subset of
      configurations from a vast configuration space that satisfies various requirements, such as functional
      constraints, resource constraints, and feature coverage constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to find a representative sample of configurations that adequately cover the variability space of the
      software product line while minimizing the number of configurations needed. This helps in reducing the complexity
      of product line management and enables efficient testing and verification of software products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various techniques, including combinatorial optimization algorithms, probabilistic sampling methods, and
      constraint solving techniques, are employed to tackle the Configuration Sampling Problem. These approaches aim to
      balance the trade-off between coverage, efficiency, and scalability to provide effective solutions for real-world
      software product line configurations.
