    <h1 class="text-h3 mb-4">Minimum Partition into Plane Subgraphs</h1>


    <p>
      As in previous years, the objective will be to compute good solutions to instances of a difficult geometric
      optimization problem. The specific problem chosen for the 2022 Challenge is Minimum Plane Partition, as follows.

    <v-divider class="my-5"></v-divider>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Given a geometric graph
      <MathFormula formula="G = (V, E)"/>
      , with vertices represented by points in the plane, and edges by straight-line connections between vertices.

      The task is to partition
      <MathFormula formula="E"/>
      E
      into as few subsets
      <MathFormula formula="E_1,\dots,E_k"/>
      as possible, such that each subgraph
      <MathFormula formula="G_i = (V, E_i)"/>
      is plane: In the given geometric representation, line segments representing edges may touch at end points if and
      only if the corresponding edges are incident in
      <MathFormula formula="G_i"/>; no edges may cross, i.e., share points that are not segment end points.
